# AI-Job-Market-Trends-in-USA-using-Tableau

Built an end-to-end interactive dashboard to analyze salary trends in AI-related roles across the U.S. Used LinkedIn job postings and implemented custom Python web scraping logic to collect and update real-time job data. Generated synthetic salary estimates based on experience level and state using rule-based mappings.

Developed a dynamic Tableau dashboard featuring:

Role-wise salary benchmarks across experience levels

Geospatial heatmaps to highlight state-wise compensation patterns

Time-based trend lines and weekday impact on salary

Interactive filtering via parameters (state, job category, experience)

This project emphasized data engineering, salary normalization, and visual analytics for labor market intelligence. Designed with recruiter usability and career planning in mind.
